# Autoscout24 Trends

AutoScout24 Trends is composed of a crawler that periodically scraps and
stores into database the cars returned by a set of search parameters, and a
Next.js webapp that allows visualizing the stored data.

## Crawler

To setup the crawler, see its [README](crawler/README.md) file.
